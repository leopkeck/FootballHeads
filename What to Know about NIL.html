      <p>NIL, or Name, Image, and Likeness, has transpired over the past
        couple of years, and there are many misconceptions about the money
        it gives, and what is is given for. NIL money is often wrongly
        though of as money that is given to an athlete, just cause. The
        reason why this topic is alway misconcieved is because you have
        probably never looked into it. The simple definition, given by <i>Icon
        Source</i>, says that, "In the simplest of terms, Name, Image and
        Likeness (NIL) is a term that describes the means through which
        college athletes are allowed to receive financial compensation.
        NIL refers to the use of an athlete's name, image, and likeness
        through marketing and promotional endeavors." The real reason these deals
        are made is because athletes are unable to be directly paid by the
        NCAA or any teams that may associate with them, because they can not be
        given money outside of scholarships. One notable case of this problem
        was with the NCAA college sports games, which showed athletes likeness,
        until they were disbanded because they could't pay the teams or the
        athletes. However, EA Sports will be able to now make the games again
        because they can pay athletes through NIL.
