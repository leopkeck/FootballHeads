      <p>Draymond Green, a prominent figure in the NBA, recently faced expulsion from a game due to hitting Phoenix center Jusuf Nurkic. Amidst the controversy, Draymond Green has taken a proactive step towards his mental well-being. In a recent statement, he acknowledged the incident, saying, "I connect with Nurkic get kicked out of the game, do my post-game interview, all of those things and as I said then and as I said now, I was wrong. I was wrong regardless of what I was trying to do, none of that sh** matters." The recognition of his actions and the commitment to mental health reflects a growing awareness within the sports community about the importance of addressing mental well-being alongside physical performance.</p>
